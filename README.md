# Simple-SnakeGame-with-Python-Pygame
My take on the simple snake game using pgame on Python. 

After doing some research i decided to make my snake game from scratch. unfortunately, it was done a while ago so i do not remember the  blogs and websites i used to prepare for it

Very straightforward, all you nneed is python ( preferably up to date), and IDE and pygame package installed.

Detailed instruction written as comments in the Python file.
Feel free to make changes that suit you.
